# Browser of the Nine Realms

## We come from the land of the ice and snow, from the midnight sun, where the hotsprings flow...
The Browser of the Nine Realms is built to be an experimental test bed product that allows an alternate browser to be used on chromebooks. It has the side effect of allowing students to avoid school proxies. So if you come from the land of the ice and snow, go ahead and download the latest version from [the Google Play Store](). If you'd rather dip your toes in the hot springs, you can clone this repository and begin development.

## Development Guide:
The business end of TBotNR is written in JavaScript, and most of the frontend is plain old CSS. There is also a smidgen of HTML sprinkled in, so if you can manage one or more of those three, we'd love to see you making forks and PRs.
